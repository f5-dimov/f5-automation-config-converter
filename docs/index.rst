F5 Automation Config Converter (ACC)
====================================
|
| The F5 Automation Config Converter (ACC) provides a way to convert configuration files to either an `Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/>`_
| or an `F5 Declarative Onboarding (DO) <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/>`_ declaration.
* DO conversions include system settings such as licensing and provisioning, network settings such as VLANs and Self IPs, and clustering settings.
* AS3 configures applications and services on a BIG-IP device that already has its initial settings.
| Conversions are based on supported classes.  For a list of the objects that are converted, see :ref:`Classes<classes>`.
| ACC is a community-supported offering. Please use `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-automation-config-converter/issues>`_ to submit an issue for our team.
