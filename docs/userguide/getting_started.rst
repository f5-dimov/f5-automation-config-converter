===============
The documentation contains information about how to install and use the F5 Automation Config Converter.
F5 Automation Config Converter is a community-supported offering. Please use `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-automation-config-converter/issues>`_ to submit an issue for our team. You can also see current Known Issues and their status on that page.

About F5 Automation Config Converter
------------------------------------
|
| The F5 Automation Config Converter, or ACC, provides a way to convert configuration files to either an `Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/>`_ or an `F5 Declarative Onboarding (DO) <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/>`_ declaration.
* DO conversions include system settings such as licensing and provisioning, network settings such as VLANs and Self IPs, and clustering settings.
* AS3 configures applications and services on a BIG-IP device that already has its initial settings.
| Conversions are based on supported classes.  For a list of objects that are converted, see the **Important Information** section below.
| The converter, which runs in a Docker container, converts **.ucs,** **.scf,** or **.conf** files, outputting to valid declaration stanzas.
|
.. NOTE::	Docker must be installed prior to using ACC. See `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/>`_ for information on installing Docker.


Important Information
---------------------

The information in this section can be used to determine if your system supports the prerequisites for ACC, some important conversion notes and privacy information.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* TMOS versions 12.1+ are supported.

* Docker must be installed prior to using ACC. See `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/>`_ for information on installing Docker.


Conversion Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Currently ACC does not support all BIG-IP configuration object types, although coverage will increase over time.

* After the conversion, some manipulation of AS3 stanzas may be required.

* The converter produces an AS3 declaration, placing any configuration objects located in  **/Common** partition on the source BIG-IP into **/Common/Shared** (an existing AS3 construct).

* For a list of the objects that are converted, see :ref:`Classes<classes>`.

* While ACC will convert a BIG-IP app services configuration created by a legacy iApp template, ACC will ignore the iApp template configuration itself.

* iRules only export in base-64.

* TLS/SSL certificates and keys are only extracted if the input source is a UCS file, and the private keys were included when the UCS was created (default option).


Privacy Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Information regarding the `Privacy Notice <https://www.f5.com/company/policies/privacy-notice>`_ for the F5, NGINX, Shape Security, and Volterra brands.

* Analytics pseudonymization process. When data is pseudonymized, the information that can point to the identity of a subject is replaced by “pseudonyms” or identifiers. This prevents the data from specifically pinpointing the user.  ACC creates a dotfile named **.f5-acc** on the filesystem, or working directory, used to run ACC via the docker container.


.. NOTE::	Passphrases/passwords CAN be extracted as a cryptogram and not cleartext, although *the output generated by the converter will only work on the same BIG-IP instance that created the configuration input.*

* Multiple Client_TLS and Server_TLS profiles have limited support.
  Configurations will be converted, but to apply them see the `Referencing multiple SSL profiles <https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/declarations/tls-encryption.html#referencing-multiple-ssl-profiles-on-a-single-virtual-service>`_ documentation.
  SSL profiles **must** exist on the BIG-IP device.

* All items on the pre-AS3 configuration must be uniquely named. BIG-IP itself allows some objects to have the same name, while AS3 does not.
  **Any object with a duplicate name will be overwritten.**

* By default, ACC sets *"shareNodes":true* for all nodes. *"shareNodes":true* is appended to the node to avoid conflicts or errors when exporting more than one AS3 configuration sharing the same node, and is set to *true* even if no duplicate nodes are configured.

  For example:

.. code-block:: none

    "web_pool1": {
        "class": "Pool",
        "members": [
            {
                "serverAddresses": [
                  "10.244.1.58"
                ],
                "servicePort": 80,
                "shareNodes": true
            }
        ]
    }
